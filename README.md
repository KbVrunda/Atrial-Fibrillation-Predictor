# Machine-Learning
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to categorize ECG data and detect atrial fibrillation (AFib). The model utilizes TensorFlow, Convolutional Layers, Keras, and Numpy to analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and classify them into four different categories.

**Usage**
1. Prepare your ECG dataset for training and testing the model.
2, Configure the model architecture in Keras, specifying Convolutional Layers and Dense Layers accordingly.
3. Train the model on your ECG data using TensorFlow as the backend.
4. Evaluate the model's performance and accuracy in detecting different types of atrial fibrillation.

**Results**

The ECG-based Atrial Fibrillation Detection model demonstrates effective categorization of ECG signals into four distinct types, corresponding to different patterns of atrial fibrillation. The utilization of Convolutional Layers allows the model to learn relevant features from the raw ECG data, while the Dense Layers aid in making accurate classifications. The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics to gauge its accuracy and reliability in real-world scenarios.
