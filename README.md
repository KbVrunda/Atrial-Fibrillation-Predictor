## Project Overview

The Atrial Fibrillation Predictor is a machine learning model that uses ECG data to predict the likelihood of a patient developing heart conditions. The model was developed using Python and popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. The goal of this project is to provide a tool that can potentially aid medical professionals in identifying patients at risk for atrial fibrillation.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.7+ and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [SciKit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/atrial-fibrillation-predictor.git

2. Install Python packages

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Dataset

The data used in this project are anonymized ECG readings from real-world patients. These data were collected and shared by [XYZ Medical Center](#). Please note that all data used for this project have been completely anonymized in accordance with HIPAA guidelines.

The dataset includes the following features:

1. `feature_1` - Description
2. `feature_2` - Description
3. ...
   
Please refer to the `data/README.md` for further details regarding the dataset.

## Model Architecture

The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for prediction. For more details about the architecture, refer to `model_architecture.md` in the `docs` directory.

## Usage

After installing the required packages and setting up the environment, you can start using the model for prediction. See `usage_example.md` in the `docs` directory for step-by-step instructions.

## Results and Evaluation

The model was evaluated using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Detailed results and discussions can be found in the `evaluation.md` in the `docs` directory.
